# Assignment 1: Demonstrate ability to "hold edges" and build crate

<h1 id="dom-i">Modeling I</h1>
<p>Now that we understand basic polygon modeling tools, we need to build our own crate using the example&nbsp; in the demos.&nbsp; These are typically called "pallet crates" but might also be called "pine crate". Start by building the simple crate. If you have time begin editing it's components to make it look more real.</p>
